A repository containing the examples from the worksheet and lecture.

## Contents

- `lect17.dart` - Code from the lecture.
- `pract17.dart` - Code from the worksheet.
- `README.md` - This file.
- `.gitignore` - A file telling git to ignore certain files. You do not need to worry about this file for now.

## Running the code

Navigate to the directory containing the code with the `cd` command, for example:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/programming/week-17-dart-code
```

Then, run the code with the `dart` command, for example:

```bash
dart pract17.dart
```

Auto-format your code (e.g., fix indentation and spacing) using the `dart format` command, for example:

```bash
dart format pract17.dart
```

Analyze to find issues with the code using the `dart analyze` command, for example:

```bash
dart analyze pract17.dart
```

And finally, fix the automatically detected issues with the `dart fix` command, for example:
